 About Us <br>
 Each donation...New joy!
 A project specialized in collecting and recycling surplus clothes and distributing them to the needy.
 The idea here, where people can enter the site and make a donation request,
 And the person who wants to take these donations can enter and choose among these donations and then
 Communicate with him to deliver him to his home,
 I wanted to start this project because there is no such website in Jordan
 The idea was to make it easier for people to get their needs from these donations and prevent them
 Embarrassment from going to associations and taking their needs.
